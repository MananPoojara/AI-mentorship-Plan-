Absolutely! Building this project is a fantastic opportunity to learn new technologies and deepen your existing skills. I‚Äôll create a **Structured Learning Plan** document that outlines everything you need to learn, step-by-step, while building the AI Mentoring System. This plan will cover **React**, **Python**, **FastAPI**, **LLaMA 2**, **DevOps**, and more.

### **4. Tips for Learning**  
1. **Build Small Projects**: Practice each concept by building small projects (e.g., a to-do app with React, a REST API with FastAPI).  
2. **Follow Tutorials**: Use YouTube tutorials and blog posts to supplement official documentation.  
3. **Ask Questions**: Join communities like Stack Overflow, Reddit, or Discord to ask questions and get help.  
4. **Stay Consistent**: Dedicate at least 1-2 hours daily to learning and coding.
